# FineTuneLlama2

## 🚀 Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 on Custom Dataset

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the [Meta LLaMA 2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) large language model using Hugging Face's `transformers` and `peft` libraries. It focuses on parameter-efficient fine-tuning using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), making it resource-friendly and scalable.

### 🧠 Model Used

* **Base Model**: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`
* **Fine-Tuning Method**: LoRA using `peft`
* **Trainer**: Hugging Face `transformers.Trainer`

---

### 📦 Dependencies

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers accelerate datasets peft trl bitsandbytes
```

Optional for using Flash Attention:

```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

### 📊 Dataset

This example uses a dummy dataset for demonstration purposes. You can replace it with any text dataset suited to your use case.

```python
from datasets import Dataset
data = {
    "text": [
        "Hello, how are you?",
        "What is the capital of France?",
        "Write a short poem on AI.",
    ]
}
dataset = Dataset.from_dict(data)
```

---

### 🔧 Training

* Fine-tuning is done using LoRA to reduce memory usage.
* Quantization (4-bit or 8-bit via `bitsandbytes`) can be optionally enabled.
* Configuration options such as learning rate, batch size, etc., are customizable.

---

### 📈 Evaluation

After training, you can evaluate the model's performance by generating outputs using:

```python
model.eval()
prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms."
```

---

### 💾 Saving the Model

Save the fine-tuned adapter and tokenizer locally:

```python
model.save_pretrained("finetuned_llama2_lora")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("finetuned_llama2_lora")
```

---

### 📝 Future Work

* Integrate with a real-world dataset (e.g., domain-specific corpus).
* Use inference APIs or deploy using Hugging Face Spaces or FastAPI.
* Add support for RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).
